                <p> In order for your Japandi living room not to fall flat or become too plain, make full use of those three to four shades to add contrast and keep the living space alive while maintaining coziness. Stay true to the muted touches and earthy tones and light, warm neutral colors to create that restrained contrast effect that is the signature Japandi style</p>

            <p>The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero’s De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.” <br> – Neil Borton</p>

            <p style="width: 70%;">To create that healthy contrast, go for light colored wood, some metal and even cork. In Japandi, you’ll see a lot of wood usage, especially in furniture; you can follow this and play around with various dark and light stains for your wooden decor. Opt for richer wood stains when it comes to central furniture like the coffee table and keep this true for the side table too. Only go lighter for other accents.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Don’t be afraid to go a step further. Incorporate white or pale grey for your couch and rug. These will enrich and perfectly complement the cozy palette going on. And for the final touch, use deep grey or black as an accent or anchor for small decor and timeless pieces.</p>
