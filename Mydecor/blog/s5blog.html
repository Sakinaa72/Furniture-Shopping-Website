                <p>Sustainable modern craftsmanship, the Arc Chair references a classic Danish aesthetic while carefully introducing sustainable values and modern craftsmanship. The archetypal unibody section that functions as both back and arm rest is a Danish archetype that dates back more than 200 years and was first inspired by furniture from ancient Greece. Special attention has been given to the balance of materials in Arc Chair’s design.
